					<p>
						Currently we have 121 dogs and 342 cats on our hands and statistics show
						that only 20% of them will find a family. The others will continue to live
						with us and will be waiting for a lucky chance to become dearly loved.
					</p>
					<p>
						We feed our wards with the best food and make sure that they do not get
						sick, feel comfortable (including psychologically) and well. We are
						supported by 87 volunteers and 28 employees of various skill levels. About
						12% of the animals are taken by the shelter staff. Taking care of the
						animals, they become attached to the pets and would hardly ever leave them
						alone.
